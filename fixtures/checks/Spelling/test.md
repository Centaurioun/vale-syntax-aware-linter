オプション

Before you get started, you may want to familiarize yourself with [GitHub Apps](/apps/), [Webhooks](/webhooks), and the [Checks API](/rest/reference/checks), if you're not already. You'll find more APIs in the [REST API docs](/rest). The Checks API is also available to use in [GraphQL]({% ifversion ghec %}/free-pro-team@latest{% endif %}/graphql), but this quickstart focuses on REST. See the GraphQL [Checks Suite]({% ifversion ghec %}/free-pro-team@latest{% endif %}/graphql/reference/objects#checksuite) and [Check Run]({% ifversion ghec %}/free-pro-team@latest{% endif %}/graphql/reference/objects#checkrun) objects for more details.
